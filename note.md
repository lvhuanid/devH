### The stack
 The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.

 plate  pile

 All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

### The heap
The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location.
