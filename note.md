### The stack
 The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.

 All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

### The heap
The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location.

after onload,the page component is triggered before rendering to Taro's virtual DOM.
### componentDidMount()

```js
export default class Test extends React.Component {
    el = createRef()

    componentDidMount () {
        console.log(this.el.current)
    }

    render () {
        return (
            <View id="only" ref={this.el} />
        )
    }
}
```
to get the real mini program rendering layer node, you need to call the API used to get the DOM in the mini program during the onReady lifecycle.
```
onReady() {
    Taro.createSelectorQuery().select("#only")
        .boundingClientRect()
        .exec(res => console.log(res))
    }
```
### entry component
every taro application needs an entry component to register the appliction. the default entry file is app.js in the directory.

in the entry component we can set the global state or access the lifecycle of the mini program entry instance.

```jsx
const store = configStore()
class App extends Component{
    componentDidMount(){}
    onLaunch(){}
    componentDidShow(){}
    componentDidHide(){}
    render(){
        return (
            <Provider store={store}>
                {this.props.children}
            </Provider>
        )
    }
}
```

```jsx
const store = configStore()
function App (props) {
    // all react hooks can be used
    useEffect(() => {})
    // onShow
    useDidShow(() => {})
    // onHide
    useDidHide(() => {})
    return (
        <Provider store={store}>
            {props.children}
        </Provider>
    )
}
```

onReachBottom(): listen to the user pull-up bottoming event.

onPageScroll(Object):listening to user swipe page events

onAddToFavorites(Object):listen to the user's click on the "Favorites"button int the upper-right corner of the menu and customize the contents of the favorites.

onShareAppMessage(Object):listen to the user's behavior when they click on the forward button (Button component openType='share') or the "Forward" button int the top-right menu,and customize the forwarding content.

Attention:
- when onShareAppMessage is not triggered,please set enableShareAppMessage:true in the page config
- only if this event handler is defined,the "Forward"button will be displayed in the upper right menu

onResize(Object):triggered when the mini program screen is rotated

  return initialState;

  return () => {

```
to avoid memory leaks, the cleanup function will be executed before the component is unmounted
### the execution time of effect
it's different from componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, taro will execute the effect callback function at the next macrotask after the completion of setData,and the function passed to useEffect will be called delayed. this makes it suitable for a lot of common side effects scenarios, such as setting up subscriptions and event handing, so ti should't to execute render and update in functions.

existing pages via stacks       reacts as follows
- initialization    the new page is pushed onto the stack
- opening a new     the new page is pushed onto the stack
- page redirection  the current page is popped out of the stack, and the new page is pushed onto the stack.
- page return       pages are successively popped out of the stack until the destination return page is displayed
- the switching     all the pages are popped out of the stack, and only the new tabpage is retained
- reloading         all the pages are popped out of the stack, and only the new page is retained.

developers can obtain the current page stack by using the getCurrentPages() function.

```
<navigator 
    open-type="navigateTo"
    "redirectTo"
    "navigateBack"
    "switchTab"
    "reLaunch"
/>
```
tips:
- navigateTo and redirectTo can be used to open non-tabBar pages only.
- switchTab can be used to open tabBar pages only.
- reLaunch canbe use to open any pages.
- the tabBar on the buttom of a page is determined by the page. in other words, tabBar is displayed on the bottom of all pages defined as tabBar.
- parameters used to call page routing can be obtained via onLoad in the destination page.

### creating types from types
- generics -types which take parameters
- keyof type operator -using the keyof operator to create new types
- typeof type operator -using the typeof operator to create new types
- indexed access types -using type['a'] syntax to access a subset of a type
- conditional types -types which act like if statements in the type system
- mapped types -creating types by mapping each property in an existing type
- template literal types -mapped types which change properties via template literal strings

the keyof operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of  its keys
```
type Point = {x: number; y: number};
type P = keyof Point;
```
if the type has a string or number index signature, keyof will return those types instead
```
type Arrayish = {[n: number]: unknown};
type A = keyof Arrayish;
// type A = number

type Mapish = {[k: string]: boolean};
type M = keyof Mapish;
// type M = string | number
```
coerced
```
let s = "ssss";
let n: typeof s;
// let n: string

type Predicate = (x: unknown) => boolean;
type K = ReturnType<Predicate>
// type K = boolean

function f() {
    return {x: 10, y: 3};
}
type P = ReturnType<typeof f>;
// type P = {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}
```

static members cannot reference class type parameters.  
types are always fully erased
The static members of a generic class can never refer to the class's type parameters.

### arrow functions
if you have a function that will often be called in a way that loses its this context, it can make sense to use an arrow function property instead of a method definition:
```
class MyClass {
    name = "mmmm";
    getName = () => {
        return this.name;
    };
}
const c = new MyClass();
const g = c.getName;
